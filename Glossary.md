## Metrics and KPIs
### Definitions
* [Stickiness](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/user-stickiness/) in marketing is a metric that gauges the frequency and depth of user engagement with an app to assess likelihood of continued engagement over time.
* An [app engagement](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/engagement/) is an interaction between a user and a mobile application/app. Engagement is measured by examining multiple metrics in tandem to produce a picture of how users are interacting with an app. Mobile advertisers use app engagement to assess and measure how their mobile campaigns are performing. Among other in-app figures, the number of in-app events triggered and how usage is affected by advertising campaigns are taken into consideration to measure engagement and user retention.

### Metrics
* Retention
   - Retention Rate = (Users retained at end of period / Users at the start of period) × 100
* Sessions | Sessions refer to the number of distinct visits a user makes, often counted when a user interacts with a site or app within a given timeframe. The total session count could vary based on how you define a "session" (e.g., 30-minute intervals).
  - Total Sessions is often simply counted by tracking each start of user engagement within the specified period.
* Session lengths
  - Average Session Length =Total time spent across all sessions /  Total number of sessions
* Daily active users (DAUs), Monthly active users (MAUs) | This ratio measures the frequency of user engagement over time, giving insight into user stickiness and engagement. This metric indicates the percentage of monthly users who return daily.
  - DAU/MAU Ratio = (Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users) × 100
* Stickiness
* Churn rate

* **Hierarchical Effects Model (HEM)**: In marketing and advertising, this model describes the stages a consumer goes through in the decision-making process, from awareness to purchase. It’s often used to structure marketing efforts to guide consumers effectively through each stage.
