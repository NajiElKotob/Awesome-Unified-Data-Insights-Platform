## Metrics and KPIs
### Definitions
* [Stickiness](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/user-stickiness/) in marketing is a metric that gauges the frequency and depth of user engagement with an app to assess likelihood of continued engagement over time.
* An [app engagement](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/engagement/) is an interaction between a user and a mobile application/app. Engagement is measured by examining multiple metrics in tandem to produce a picture of how users are interacting with an app. Mobile advertisers use app engagement to assess and measure how their mobile campaigns are performing. Among other in-app figures, the number of in-app events triggered and how usage is affected by advertising campaigns are taken into consideration to measure engagement and user retention.
* A mobile [app event](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/events/) is an action performed by users within an app. An app event can be anything a mobile marketer or developer determines is helpful to measure. Often discussed in mobile marketing, a revenue event is any action performed by users within an app that is connected to a monetary value. A few examples of mobile app events that might be measured include a user completing a level of a game, visiting a particular section of an app, or making a purchase. Any and all actions that are defined as an event can be tracked with your mobile measurement partner (MMP) to learn how users interact with your app.
* [What is attribution? منسوب إلى](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/attribution/) In mobile app marketing measurement, "attributed to" means assigning or giving credit to a specific marketing channel or campaign for driving an install or engagement.
* [Reattribution](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/reattribution) is when an inactive user engages with a retargeting campaign, returns to your app, and gets assigned a new source.
* StoreKit Ad Network, otherwise known as [SKAdNetwork](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/skadnetwork-skan/) or SKAN, is Apple’s API-based, privacy-centric framework for attribution and ad measurement. It provides aggregated insights to advertisers with no user level data.
* Mobile app [user acquisition](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/user-acquisition/) (UA) is the process of bringing new users to an app. It usually refers to driving installs via paid or organic advertising campaigns.
* A [mobile measurement partner (MMP)](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/mobile-measurement-partner-mmp/) is a company that acts as a third-party provider to attribute, collect, and organize app data to deliver a unified overview of a brand’s campaign performance. With an overwhelming volume of campaign data across multiple ad networks, it can be difficult for app marketers to determine which channels, media sources, publishers, or campaigns are leading to conversions. Mobile measurement partners provide marketers with an impartial and accurate overview of mobile attribution by indicating which source should receive credit for driving a conversion.

### Metrics
* Retention
   - Retention Rate = (Users retained at end of period / Users at the start of period) × 100
* Sessions | Sessions refer to the number of distinct visits a user makes, often counted when a user interacts with a site or app within a given timeframe. The total session count could vary based on how you define a "session" (e.g., 30-minute intervals).
  - Total Sessions is often simply counted by tracking each start of user engagement within the specified period.
* Session lengths
  - Average Session Length =Total time spent across all sessions /  Total number of sessions
* Daily active users (DAUs), Monthly active users (MAUs) | This ratio measures the frequency of user engagement over time, giving insight into user stickiness and engagement. This metric indicates the percentage of monthly users who return daily.
  - DAU/MAU Ratio = (Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users) × 100
* Stickiness
* Churn rate | Churn rate measures the percentage of users who stop using a product within a specified period.
  - Churn Rate = (Users lost during period / Total users at start of period) × 100

## General
* **CX** stands for Customer Experience. It encompasses all interactions a customer has with a company, from initial contact through purchase and post-sale support, aiming to create a positive and seamless journey that fosters loyalty and satisfaction.
* **Hierarchical Effects Model (HEM)**: In marketing and advertising, this model describes the stages a consumer goes through in the decision-making process, from awareness to purchase. It’s often used to structure marketing efforts to guide consumers effectively through each stage.
* **SMO**, or Social Media Optimization, is the practice of enhancing a brand's visibility and engagement on social media platforms through optimized profiles, shareable content, and interaction strategies.
* **Single Point of Ownership (SPO)** Framework: This framework would assign a single person or team as the accountable entity for specific tasks, processes, or projects. It’s designed to clarify roles, reduce redundancies, and streamline communication, making sure each initiative has a clear "owner" responsible for its success.

* A **"gesture"** (إيماءة, إشارة) refers to the various touch interactions a user makes with the screen on a mobile device. These gestures are tracked to understand user behavior and interaction with the app. These gestures provide insights into user engagement and usability, helping analysts identify areas of the app where users interact the most, encounter difficulties, or abandon tasks.
  1. **Tap**: A single quick touch on the screen, typically used for selecting or activating elements.
  2. **Double Tap**: Two quick taps in succession, often used for zooming in or other app-specific functions.
  3. **Long Press**: A touch held down for a longer period, usually to access additional options or initiate drag-and-drop actions.
  4. **Swipe**: A quick, directional movement (up, down, left, or right) used for scrolling, navigating between screens, or dismissing elements.
  5. **Pinch**: A two-finger gesture where the fingers are brought together to zoom out or pulled apart to zoom in.
  6. **Drag**: Moving an element from one part of the screen to another by holding down and moving the finger.

## Security
* [SDK spoofing](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/sdk-spoofing/) is the creation of legitimate-looking installs with data of real devices without the presence of any actual installs. Fraudsters utilize a real device to create installs that look real to consume an advertiser’s budget. It is also known as traffic spoofing and replay attacks.
